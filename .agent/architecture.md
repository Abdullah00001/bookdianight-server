## Data Flow & Operations

### Request Flow
**Internet** → **Nginx** (Reverse Proxy / TLS Termination) → **server** (Express/Node.js) → **PostgreSQL** (Managed) / **Valkey** (Redis cache).

### Background Flow
**server** / **scheduler** (Producers) → Enqueue jobs into **Valkey** (BullMQ backend) → **worker** (Consumer process).

### Database Flow
**Prisma** (`schema.prisma`) → Applies schema via `db-migrator` container → **PostgreSQL** (with PostGIS extensions).

### Deployment Lifecycle
1. **Git tag** (e.g., `v1.0.14`) pushed to GitHub.
2. **GitHub Actions** builds immutable Docker images.
3. Images pushed to **DOCR** (DigitalOcean Container Registry).
4. GitHub runner injects dynamic ephemeral IP into **DO Cloud Firewall** (TCP 22).
5. GitHub runner SSHs into **Droplet**.
6. Droplet pulls `IMAGE_TAG` and executes **Docker Compose**.
7. Ephemeral IP is revoked.

## Infrastructure Ownership

- **Permanent Cloud Infra**: Owned completely by `Terraform`.
- **Server Provisioning**: Owned completely by `Ansible`.
- **Application Deployment**: Owned completely by `GitHub Actions` and `Docker Compose`.
- **Database Schema**: Owned completely by `Prisma`.
