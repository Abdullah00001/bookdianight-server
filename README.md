# BookdiaNight Server

Welcome to the **BookdiaNight Server** project! This repository contains the complete backend infrastructure and application code for the BookdiaNight platform.

This is a **Docker-centric** backend. The application relies on a multi-service architecture where separate containers handle specific responsibilities, backed by robust managed cloud infrastructure.

- **Local Development**: Strictly uses Docker Compose. Do **NOT** run the Node.js services directly on your host machine.
- **Application Services**: Runs `server`, `worker`, and `scheduler` as completely isolated containers.
- **Relational Database**: PostgreSQL (with PostGIS extensions) serves as the primary data store.
- **Caching & Queues**: Valkey (Redis) handles in-memory caching, background job queues, and WebSocket pub/sub.
- **Data Access**: Prisma ORM provides strict type-safe database queries.
- **Background Jobs**: BullMQ handles offloaded tasks like emails and push notifications.
- **Realtime**: Socket.IO handles bidirectional real-time WebSocket communication.

## 👨‍💻 New Developer? Start Here

Welcome to the team! Local development is vastly different from production deployment. Your first objective is to run the API locally on your machine.

**Your Recommended Path:**
1. Read this entire README.
2. Read the full [Developer Workflow](docs/developer-workflow.md).
3. Install required tools (Docker, Docker Compose, Node.js).
4. Configure your `.env` securely by duplicating `.env.example`.
5. Start the local stack via `docker compose up -d --build`.
6. Verify PostgreSQL and Valkey booted successfully.
7. Generate and sync your Prisma client using `npm run prisma:migrate` && `npm run prisma:sync`.
8. Verify the `server`, `worker`, and `scheduler` containers are healthy.
9. Review the [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) document to understand how requests flow.
10. Start coding!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A new developer should **never** begin by attempting to run Terraform, executing Ansible playbooks, SSH'ing into the VPS, or manipulating GitHub Actions. Leave production infrastructure alone until you are completely familiar with the core application.

## 🚀 Production / DevOps

Production infrastructure is rigorously separated from daily application development. 

The baseline infrastructure (Firewalls, VPC, Spaces, Droplet) is managed by **Terraform**. Server provisioning (Docker setup, Nginx, SSH hardening) is managed by **Ansible**. Application deployments are entirely managed by **GitHub Actions**.

> [!CAUTION]
> **DO NOT manually SSH into production to pull code, restart containers, or change `.env` files for normal deployments.**

The strict, automated release path is:

1. **Code**: Develop features locally.
2. **Commit**: Merge approved PRs into `main`.
3. **Version Bump**: Update `package.json` version.
4. **Git Tag**: Create an immutable tag (e.g., `v1.0.15`).
5. **GitHub Actions**: The CI/CD pipeline triggers automatically.
6. **Build Images**: Docker images are built via Buildx.
7. **Push Images**: Immutable versioned images are pushed to DOCR.
8. **Temporary Firewall Whitelist**: The CI runner's dynamic IP is temporarily allowed into the DO Cloud Firewall.
9. **Deploy**: The runner SSHs in and updates the `IMAGE_TAG`.
10. **Migration**: The `db-migrator` container initializes and applies Prisma schemas.
11. **Health Verification**: Production services boot sequentially.
12. **Firewall Cleanup**: The dynamic IP is strictly revoked.

For details, read [Production Deployment](docs/production-deployment.md).

## 📦 Release & Versioning

The project enforces strict versioning. Currently, version bumping is a **manual** process that must be coordinated before creating a Git tag.

**Versioning Policy**: Semantic Versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).

**The Authoritative Source**: The **Git Tag** (e.g., `v1.0.15`) is the absolute source of truth for deployments. GitHub Actions uses the Git tag to label Docker images (`IMAGE_TAG`) in DigitalOcean Container Registry. While the root `package.json` should be manually kept in sync with the tag, the CI/CD pipeline purely respects the Git tag.

**How to Release Safely**:
1. Update root `package.json` version to match your target release.
2. Update `package-lock.json` consistently (`npm install`).
3. Commit the version bump to `main`.
4. Create the precise Git tag: `git tag vX.Y.Z` (e.g., `git tag v1.0.15`).
5. Push the commit and the tag to GitHub: `git push origin main && git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
6. GitHub Actions takes over and deploys.

**Rollbacks**:
Because Docker images are immutable and tagged via Git, rolling back is instantaneous. You merely revert the `IMAGE_TAG` to the previous version and restart containers.
*Limitation*: Prisma database migrations are **forward-only**. Application image rollback does not automatically rollback the database schema. Ensure migrations are forward-compatible.

---

## 📦 Services

The application consists of the following distinct microservices sharing a central database:

- **`server`**: The core Node.js Express API. Handles HTTP REST requests and Socket.IO realtime traffic.
- **`worker`**: The BullMQ background daemon. Consumes asynchronous jobs from Valkey (e.g., emails, push notifications, heavy crunching).
- **`scheduler`**: A lightweight cron daemon. Acts purely as a producer to enqueue scheduled jobs into Valkey.
- **`db-migrator`**: An ephemeral container that runs exclusively during production deployments to execute `prisma migrate deploy` before the persistent services boot.

---

## 💾 Database Development

We use Prisma as our ORM. The workflow is highly structured to accommodate Docker:

1. **Modify Schema**: Edit `prisma/schema.prisma`.
2. **Migration**: Run `npm run prisma:migrate` (Applies changes to the local DB and updates the host client).
3. **Container Sync**: Run `npm run prisma:sync` (Compiles the Alpine Linux Prisma binaries inside the running Docker containers).
4. **Service Usage**: Services can now safely query the new schema.

Read [Database Architecture](docs/database.md) for details on PostGIS and migrations.

## 🧭 Source of Truth

To prevent confusion and configuration drift, respect the following strict ownership boundaries:

- **Application behavior** → Source code (`server`, `worker`, `scheduler`).
- **Database schema** → `prisma/schema.prisma`.
- **Database migration history** → `prisma/migrations/`.
- **Local orchestration** → `docker-compose.yaml`.
- **Permanent infrastructure** → `infrastructure/terraform/`.
- **Server provisioning** → `infrastructure/ansible/`.
- **Deployment automation** → `.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`.
- **Production release identity** → The precise Git Tag (`vX.Y.Z`).
- **Detailed operational procedures** → `docs/`.
- **AI coding constraints** → `.agent/`.

Documentation describes the implementation; it must never become a competing source of truth.

## 🤖 AI / Agentic Development

We fully support AI coding agents collaborating on this repository. However, AI agents **must** follow repository-specific constraints.

**AI agents must follow [docs/developer-workflow.md](docs/developer-workflow.md) exactly and must use existing repository scripts/generators whenever applicable.**

Agents and developers must abide by the rules defined in:
- [docs/ai-agent-guide.md](docs/ai-agent-guide.md)
- [.agent/rules.md](.agent/rules.md)
- [docs/commit-convention.md](docs/commit-convention.md)

**Source of Truth Principle:** Existing repository documentation and tooling take precedence over an AI agent's preferred workflow.

**The Required Agent Workflow:**
AI agents are strictly bound to an **18-step mandatory workflow** (see [.agent/workflow.md](.agent/workflow.md)). The most critical requirements are:
1. **NO GUESSING**: If requirements are missing or ambiguous, the AI must STOP and ask.
2. **IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**: The AI must provide a detailed implementation plan before modifying any files.
3. **EXPLICIT APPROVAL GATE**: The AI MUST WAIT for explicit human approval (e.g., "Proceed") before executing any state-changing action.

**Strict Agent Prohibitions:**
AI agents must **NOT** casually:
- Modify production containers.
- Execute `terraform apply` or `ansible-playbook` against production.
- Modify DO Cloud Firewall rules manually.
- Rotate secrets or rewrite `.env` blindly.
- Alter production database data.
- Push Git tags or create releases.
- Modify CI/CD security parameters.
- Execute destructive `rm -rf` or `down -v` commands.

---

## ⚠️ Security Warning

- **NEVER** commit secrets, API keys, or private SSH keys.
- **NEVER** place the production `.env` file in Git.
- **NEVER** expose the internal PostgreSQL (`5432`) or Valkey (`6379`) ports to the public internet.
- **NEVER** re-open SSH (`22`) to `0.0.0.0/0` as a permanent solution; always use the CI/CD dynamic whitelist or VPN.
- **NEVER** perform destructive Prisma operations (`prisma db push`, `prisma migrate reset`) against the production database.

---
