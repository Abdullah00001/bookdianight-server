# Database Architecture

## 1. PostgreSQL & Prisma

BookDiaNight uses a Managed PostgreSQL database. The schema is entirely managed through the **Prisma ORM**.

### Prisma Schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
The schema acts as the single source of truth for the data model, enforcing strict referential integrity and type safety across the TypeScript backend.

- **PostGIS Extensions:** The schema explicitly loads `postgis`, `fuzzystrmatch`, `postgis_tiger_geocoder`, and `postgis_topology` to support advanced location-based queries (e.g., finding Clubs/Events within a radius).
- **Core Models:**
  - `User` / `Profile` / `Device`: Core identity and authentication.
  - `Club` / `Event`: Primary domain models representing physical locations and temporal gatherings. Includes spatial `lat`, `lng`, and `geog` coordinates for PostGIS.
  - `ClubReview`, `ClubOpeningHour`, `ClubPackage`: Granular relational models for clubs.
  - `Wishlist`: Many-to-many joins connecting Users to Clubs/Events.
  - `Notification`: In-app notification history.

### Referential Integrity
All relations heavily utilize `@relation(..., onDelete: Cascade)`. For example, deleting a `User` will automatically cascade and delete their `Profile`, `Device`, `Notification`, `Club`, and `Event` records to prevent orphaned data.

## 2. Migrations & Workflow

Database changes in Prisma are **forward-only**. 

> [!WARNING]
> **No Automatic Database Rollback**
> If a production deployment fails, rolling back the application `IMAGE_TAG` to a previous version is trivial. However, Prisma does **not** automatically rollback database schema changes. Migrations must be carefully authored to be forward-compatible.

### Local Development Workflow
When a developer modifies `schema.prisma`:
1. Run `npm run prisma:migrate`. This generates the migration SQL file, applies it to the local PostGIS container, and generates the Prisma client for the host OS.
2. Run `npm run prisma:sync`. This executes `npx prisma generate` inside the running Docker containers so they compile the engine binary required for Alpine Linux.

### Production Migration Sequence (`db-migrator`)
In production, the database is never migrated manually. The migration sequence is governed by a strict initialization gate in Docker Compose.

1. **db-migrator Container Starts:** During deployment, Docker Compose boots an ephemeral container (`db-migrator`) that uses the exact same `bookdianight-server` image but overrides the entrypoint to run `npx prisma migrate deploy`.
2. **Execution:** The migrator connects to the managed PostgreSQL database and applies any pending `.sql` migration files stored in `prisma/migrations/`.
3. **Graceful Exit:** If successful, the `db-migrator` exits with code `0`.
4. **Service Boot:** The `server`, `worker`, and `scheduler` containers are strictly configured with `depends_on: db-migrator: condition: service_completed_successfully`. They remain paused until the migrator finishes. Once the migrator exits with `0`, the continuous services boot safely against a fully synchronized database schema.
