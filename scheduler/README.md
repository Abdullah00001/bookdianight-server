# Scheduler Service

The `scheduler` service handles scheduled and recurring background tasks.

> [!WARNING]
> **This project is strictly Docker-centric.**
> Run the scheduler only through Docker Compose.
> Do not start Redis, MongoDB, or the scheduler process directly on the host.

> Docker-first note: this service should be started through the root Docker Compose setup so it can use the shared Redis and MongoDB containers correctly.

## Responsibilities

- scheduler startup and lifecycle management
- registration of recurring jobs
- periodic maintenance and scheduled workflows
- Redis and MongoDB access for job coordination

## Scripts

From this folder, you can run:

```bash
npm run build
npm run test
npm run start
npm run dev
npm run format
npm run lint
```

### Script details

- `build`: creates a production build. *Note: strictly enforces linting and testing via `scripts/build.sh` before compiling.*
- `test`: placeholder for testing.
- `start`: runs the compiled scheduler service.
- `dev`: starts the service in development mode with nodemon.
- `format`: formats the source code.
- `lint`: checks for lint issues.

## Adding New Jobs

The scheduler uses a **dynamic registry** for node-cron jobs. You do not need to manually import or register new jobs. 

To create a new background job, run the following command from the **project root**:

```bash
npm run create:job my-new-job
```

This will automatically generate a fully-typed boilerplate module in `src/app/jobs/my-new-job/` containing `.types.ts` and `.tasks.ts`. The scheduler will automatically discover and execute it based on the schedule provided.

## Development Notes

- The service is meant to stay running continuously when scheduled workflows are needed.
- It depends on Redis and MongoDB for runtime state and coordination.
- It mirrors the worker startup pattern so that background jobs can be managed consistently.

## Useful Commands

```bash
docker compose logs -f scheduler
docker compose restart scheduler
docker compose exec scheduler sh
```
